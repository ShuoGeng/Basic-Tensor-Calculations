# Basic Tensor Calculations
This repository will show some basic tensor calculations
1. In file Givens_Householder_transformation.py, it will randomly generate two nonzero vectors $\xi$ and $\eta$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, with $\lVert x \rVert_2$. where the dimensions of two vectors will be given by users. It will show the matrix generated by way of Givens transformation and Householder transformation. Then it will verify the matrix $U$ transforms the $\xi$ vectors into the $\eta$ vectors. Finally, it will verify: $UU^{\dagger}= I_n$. The program will be looped 3 times, which means that the user need to give the dimension parameter 3 times.
